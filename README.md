# Analysing-Employee-Exit-Surveys
INTRODUCTION: In this project, I will be working with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. I will be answering two basic questions with these datasets which are:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
Did more employees in the DETE survey or TAFE survey end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?
